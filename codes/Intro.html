    	<h1>Official Development Assistance</h1>
        
        <p>
            On this site you can see the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) countries have donated and received in the period between 2005 and 2014. When clicking on a donor country a linegraph and a barchart appear. The linegraph shows the total amount of ODA in current US dollars given in the period, and the barchart shows the various sectors the ODA has been divided over in that year. When you move the mouse over the linegraph the barchart and map show the data of the selected year. The map of the receiving countries also shows a linegraph per country, but there is no data available for the aid received per sector.

        <h3>Defenition ODA</h3>
        <p>
            Official Development Assistance (ODA) is defined as those flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the following tests: i) it is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and ii) it is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the receiving countries we can see that the ODA can be negative this is because when calculating net ODA, loan repayments are recorded as negative and deducted from ODA and loans. In some cases loan repayments are higher than new ODA and net ODA will show as a negative number.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Sectors</h3>
        <p>
            The donated ODA is divided in various sectors, the sectors are defined as the following.
